<p>This variant does not give explicit permission to redistribute unmodified copies, however, since it does give permission to "copy" unmodifed copies, we are interpreting it that way. Also, since it does grant explicit permission to redistribute modified code, we feel the intent was to grant permission to redistribute unmodified copies as well. That said, this license is poorly worded, and we do not recommend its use.
